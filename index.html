      <h2>Ain't it Cool?</h2>
      <p>
        “YAML Ain’t Markup Language” (abbreviated YAML) is a data serialization
        language designed to be human-friendly and work well with modern
        programming languages for common everyday tasks. And now we finally
        have a real web site, <a href="http://yaml.io">http://yaml.io</a>!

      <h2>Yellow is the new...</h2>
      <p>
        YAML has a new color. Yellow! Yellow almost sounds like YAML. YAML is
        all about organizing info, just like those little yellow sticky things.
        Yellow is the color of learning. You know, school buses and #2 pencils.
        Yellow is the new YAML!

      <h2>Abstractions</h2>
      <p>
      This new site, <a href="http://yaml.io">yaml.io</a>, was launched at
      <a href="http://abstractions.io">abstractions.io</a> in Pittsburgh.
      Thanks to everyone who made the Abstractions Conference the big new hit
      in Open Source.
      </p>
      <p>
      YAML thanks you!
